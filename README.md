# LearnTarot-REBUILD
Rebuilding the BAMF, HIT 90's website of the 90s using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS

Original site and the apple of my all-seeing eye: http://learntarot.com/

It was made in the 90s. WITH TABLES.

LOOK AT IT.

It looks SO GOOD. 

She has aged quite well I must admit... beautiful.

The site has a great designer, presumeably Joan Bunning.

As an exercise in exercising my dormant elementary WEB DEV SKILLZ I wish to introduce this beautiful websiteof yesteryear into the modern era, gently, at first, with a re-imaging as the same static website but built using modern HTML, CSS and JS.

Afterwards however it is my intention to reimagine the website as a fully-functional web-app created with React, simply because I can.

One step at a time though...
